###   Paper_1: A Lightweight Scalable Blockchain for IoT security and anonymity
* Lightweight Scalable blockchain (LSB) 
* optimized for IoT requirements
* providing end-to-end security
* propose a Distributed Time-based Consensus algorithm
* Distributed Throughput Management 

### Paper_6 = A Proof-of-Transactions Blockchain Consensus Protocol for Large-Scale IoT
* round-based two-stage blockchain consensus protocol called Proof-of-Transactions 

### Paper_7 = CrowdLBM: A lightweight blockchain-based model for mobile crowdsensing in the Internet of Things 
* crowdsensing model named CrowdLBM with a novel consensus mechanism
* twostage scheme and two types of smart contracts to support the crowdsensing process automatically without the intervention of any third party. 
* implement a blockchain prototype on Hyperledger Sawtooth, extensive experimental results show that the proposed CrowdLBM outperforms other crowdsensing systems in terms of both scalability and security.

### Paper_8 = Green-PoW: An energy-efficient blockchain Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm 
* repurposing the power spent during the mining process.



### Paper_21 = Improved Fault-Tolerant Consensus Based on the PBFT Algorithm
* high fault tolerance consensus algorithm NBFT, which follows the principle of decentralization and democratization

### Paper_22 = A Machine Learning Consensus Based Light-Weight Blockchain Architecture for Internet of Things
* Machine learning Consensus based Light-weight Blockchain (MCLB)
* resource-constrained edge devices in IoT
* detect malicious data besides providing the consensus for maintaining the integrity of data.
